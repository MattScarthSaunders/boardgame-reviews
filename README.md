# nc-games project

# environment variable setup

When initialising the project, create both .env.development and .env.test files. Inside of .env.test enter: 'PGDATABASE=nc_games_test' and inside of .env.development enter: 'PGDATABASE=nc_games', both without quotation marks. Ensure that .env.\* is added to the .gitignore file.
